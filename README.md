# Association for Pathology Informatics R Workshop

## Welcome!

This introductory R virtual workshop aims to teach participants with little or no programming experience the basics of the R statistical programming language for reproducible laboratory data analytics. R is a freely available programming environment that is aimed squarely at common activities in data analysis including complex data manipulation, statistical analysis, automation, and publication-quality data visualization. We will introduce basic concepts of R programming as well as more generalizable best practices in working with laboratory data.

## Before you arrive

### Get Ready...

For the best experience, please have the following ready before the workshop begins:

**- We will use RStudio Cloud as our training environment. Please sign up for a free account [here](https://rstudio.cloud/).**
- Preferably two monitors (or two laptops), one for the Zoom conference software, and one in which you will work. 
- Install the latest version of [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download).
- Install the latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) as some [older browsers](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/227449447-Supported-browsers-for-RStudio-Connect) may not be compatible with the RStudio application).

### Get Set...

- Please complete the following survey so we can better understand your R experience and what you want out of the course: [API R Workshop Participant Survey](https://forms.gle/Xe3U71ZBZRmrP2E87).

### Go!

The workshop is scheduled to begin on Thursday, June 1, 2023 at 1 pm ET. Please make every effort to arrive  10 - 15 minutes early to allow time to get settled and ensure your computer is set up.

## Accessing/interacting with the course content

1. Course content will be pre-loaded in the RStudio instance that we will be working with on the day of the workshop and will be available for download there as a .zip file.
2. The content is also available now at [our course github page](https://github.com/amromeo/api_r2023) and can be downloaded from there as well.

## Installing RStudio onto your own computer

We will be utilizing our own cloud based RStudio instance in the workshop. However, _in the long term_, you will need R and RStudio installed **on your own computer** in order to work on private data. You can find step by step instructions for installing these on macOS ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM88tYlEy_g)) or Windows ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRKmZK5-6aE)).

## Acknowledgments

All of the course instructors have previous experience implementing and executing R workshops at a variety of venues. The workshop we are presenting for the API community is in many ways a product of these past experiences. The workshop also integrates content, best practices, and lessons from a variety of educators in the R community. We would like to specifically acknowledge: 

- [MSACL Data Science 201](https://github.com/pcmathias/MSACL-intermediate-R-course), a course produced by Patrick Mathias and several collaborators, presented at the Mass Spectrometry: Applications to the Clinical Lab meeting.
- Stephan Kadauke's R workshop for Pathology trainees and faculty, developed at the Massachusetts General Hospital and the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania
- Steve Master and Dan Holmes's AACC Introduction to R Workshop 
- [Data Science in the Tidyverse](https://github.com/AmeliaMN/data-science-in-tidyverse), a RStudio course with materials posted online
- [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html), the online textbook by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham, is invaluable in navigating the tidyverse and learning R in general
- Blog posts and documentation by [Jenny Bryan](https://github.com/jennybc) helped steer the project content and as well as some discussion about packages
- Amy Willis' [Advanced R Course repository](https://github.com/adw96/biostat561) as a resource for understanding content in a longer, advanced R course
- Keith Baggerly and Karl Broman's [Reproducible Research](https://github.com/kabagg/sisbid_2018_rr) module at the [Summer Institute in Statistics for Big Data](https://www.biostat.washington.edu/suminst/sisbid) - a big thank you to Keith Baggerly for all of his input and guidance!
- Greg Wilson's [Teaching Tech Together](http://teachtogether.tech/en/), which offers practical advice about teaching programming. 
- Claus Wilke's [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://serialmentor.com/dataviz/), a compendium of Do's and Don'ts of data visualization. 
- Method validation and some other content has been borrowed from the [basic R course at AACC](https://github.com/pcmathias/AACC-Introduction-to-R)
